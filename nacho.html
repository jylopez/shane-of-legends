      For you.
      <br/>
      One for you.
      <br/>
      For you.
      <br/>
      One for you.
      <br/>
      One for you.
      <br/>
      How come we can't ever have
      <br/>
      just, like, a salad?
      <br/>
      Be grateful, Juan Pablo.
      <br/>
      Today is especially delicious.
      <br/>
      Orphans, smile and be happy,
      <br/>
      for God has blessed us with a new teacher.
      <br/>
      She hails from

      <br/>
      Sister Encarnacin.
      <br/>
      Thank you, Brother.
      <br/>
      Children, today I want to tell you
      <br/>
      a story about Isabel.
      <br/>
      Okay, new game.
      <br/>
      -Go get it!
      <br/>
      -Hey, that's my ball!
      <br/>
      Sister.
      <br/>
      I'm Ignacio.
      <br/>
      God be with you, Ignacio.
      <br/>
      Anyways,
      <br/>
      I was wondering
      <br/>
      if you would like to join me
      <br/>
      in my quarters this night for some toast.
      <br/>
      Look alive!
      <br/>
      There is a man sick with influenza.
      <br/>
      I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?
      <br/>
      -But the sister and I...
      <br/>
      -You are always complaining
      <br/>
      of never having priestly duties.
      <br/>
      Here is your big duty, huh?
      <br/>
      Go now,
      <br/>
      so that Sister and I may talk
      <br/>
      of holy things.
      <br/>
      I like your cow.
      <br/>
      Where is he?
      <br/>
      Holy Father, please receive this man
      <br/>
      to your kingdom.
      <br/>
      Thank you for coming here today.
      <br/>
      This man lived a good life.
      <br/>
      He had a wonderful woman,
      <br/>
      a lush garden,
      <br/>
      and a collection
      <br/>
      of Russian nesting dolls.
      <br/>
      May he rest in peace.
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      Hey!

      <br/>
      Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      How's it going?
      <br/>
      It's very late, Ignacio.
      <br/>
      Give me a second.
      <br/>
      Good toast.
      <br/>
      So,
      <br/>
      everyone calls you gero.
      <br/>
      My mother was a Lutheran missionary
      <br/>
      from Scandinavia
      <br/>
      and my father, a deacon from Mexico.
      <br/>
      They tried to convert each other,
      <br/>
      but they got married instead.
      <br/>
      And then they died.
      <br/>
      So anyways, let's get down
      <br/>
      to the nitty-gritty.
      <br/>
      Tell me,
      <br/>
      who is this Encarnacin?
      <br/>
      Well,
      <br/>
      my favorite color is light tan.
      <br/>
      My favorite animal is puppies.
      <br/>
      I like serving the Lord.
      <br/>
      Hiking.
      <br/>
      Play volleyball.
      <br/>
      You gotta be kidding me.
      <br/>
      Everything you just said
      <br/>
      is my favorite thing to do
      <br/>
      every day.
      <br/>
      So, you enjoy yourself here
      <br/>
      at the Brotherhood?
      <br/>
      The children, I love the children.
      <br/>
      They are my heart.
      <br/>
      But to tell you the truth,
      <br/>
      the brothers make me cook stew
      <br/>
      and stuff all day,
      <br/>
      but they don't give me money
      <br/>
      for fresh ingredients.
      <br/>
      And they don't think I know a buttload
      <br/>
      of crap about the Gospel, but I do.
      <br/>
      Okay?
      <br/>
      Today, I saw a man in town.
      <br/>
      People were throwing daisies at him
      <br/>
      and giving him goodies.
      <br/>
      Sometimes I would like
      <br/>
      that kind of respect.
      <br/>
      Who was this man?
      <br/>
      Well, to tell you the truth,
      <br/>
      he was a luchador.
      <br/>
      Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.
      <br/>
      People cheer for him,
      <br/>
      but he is a false idol.
      <br/>
      Whatever.
      <br/>
      Be patient, Brother.
      <br/>
      This, too, shall pass.
      <br/>
      What is this?
      <br/>
      Leftovers.
      <br/>
      Enjoy.
      <br/>
      There is no flavor.
      <br/>
      There are no spices.
      <br/>
      Where are the chips?
      <br/>
      Somebody stole them.
      <br/>
      Did you not tell them
      <br/>
      that they were the Lord's chips?
      <br/>
      I was trying to...
      <br/>
      -You are useless, Ignacio.
      <br/>
      -Silence, Brothers.
      <br/>
      This is the worst lunch I ever had.
      <br/>
      Your only job is to cook.
      <br/>
      Do you not realize
      <br/>
      I have had diarrhea since Easters?
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      Maybe I am not meant for these duties.
      <br/>
      Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.
      <br/>
      Maybe it's time for me
      <br/>
      to get a better duty.
      <br/>
      I think your food is good.
      <br/>
      I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny,
      <br/>
      and I will have my glory day
      <br/>
      in the hot sun.
      <br/>
      Okay?
      <br/>
      See you.
      <br/>
      Hey! Listen to me! Hey!
      <br/>
      Mucho take it easy. I need your help.
      <br/>
      Take out the legs!
      <br/>
      Listen to me!
      <br/>
      Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
      <br/>
      but first I need a man.
      <br/>
      Get off me!
      <br/>
      Don't you see?
      <br/>
      Your skills plus my skills
      <br/>
      in the ring, tag team.
      <br/>
      You're crazy!
      <br/>
      Aren't you tired
      <br/>
      of getting dirt kicked in your face?
      <br/>
      I am!
      <br/>
      Don't you want a little taste of the glory?
      <br/>
      See what it tastes like?
      <br/>
      No!
      <br/>
      lf we win, we get 200 pesos!
      <br/>
      Chancho!
      <br/>
      Chancho!
      <br/>
      Chancho, I need to borrow
      <br/>
      some sweats.
      <br/>
      Are you leaving us?
      <br/>
      No, Chancho, I would never leave you.
      <br/>
      I just need to borrow some sweats.

      His hair. We bet his hair.
      <br/>
      What?
      <br/>
      You can take the Stallion.
      <br/>
      I'll take the Pony.
      <br/>
      I can't wrestle him.
      <br/>
      But you are tall and fast like a gazelle.
      <br/>
      You can do it.
      <br/>
      Pray to the Lord for strength.
      <br/>
      I don't believe in God,
      <br/>
      I believe in science.
      <br/>
      You have not been baptized?
      <br/>
      Hey. How you doing?
      <br/>
      He's good.
      <br/>
      Hello!
      <br/>
      I'm talking to you. I will come.
      <br/>
      Save me a piece of that corn.
      <br/>
      Save me a piece of that corn for later.
      <br/>
      Hey. Take it easy.
      <br/>
      Come on, Esqueleto!
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      No problem. We are dancing.
      <br/>
      That didn't hurt!
      <br/>
      And then I disappear!
      <br/>
      Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.
      <br/>
      The shoe!
      <br/>
      Anaconda squeeze.
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!
      <br/>
      Semental! Semental!
      <br/>
      Semental! Semental!
      <br/>
      Those guys were
      <br/>
      a couple of wussies, huh?
      <br/>
      They scalped my hairs, okay?
      <br/>
      -I look hideous.
      <br/>
      -Come on, baby.
      <br/>
      And you gave them permission
      <br/>
      to hurt me like this.
      <br/>
      But I couldn't have anybody see
      <br/>
      my face, Steven, come on.
      <br/>
      Tonight,
      <br/>
      I felt something deep inside me,
      <br/>
      I've never felt before.
      <br/>
      Do you remember that one time
      <br/>
      when everyone was shouting my name
      <br/>
      and I used my strength
      <br/>
      to rip my blouse?
      <br/>
      Yeah.
      <br/>
      And I saw them
      <br/>
      knock you unconscious, all right?
      <br/>
      What's this?
      <br/>
      It's money. What did you think?
      <br/>
      But we lost.
      <br/>
      We all get a piece.
      <br/>
      Listen,
      <br/>
      the people, they like you guys.
      <br/>
      Come back next week,
      <br/>
      and I will get another fight for you.
      <br/>
      Chancho.
      <br/>
      When you are a man
      <br/>
      sometimes you wear stretchy pants
      <br/>
      in your room.
      <br/>
      It's for fun.
      <br/>
      Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.
      <br/>
      I'm a little concerned right now.
      <br/>
      About your salvation and stuff.
      <br/>
      How come you have not been baptized?
      <br/>
      Because I never got around to it, okay?
      <br/>
      I don't know why you always
      <br/>
      have to be judging me
      <br/>
      because I only believe in science.
      <br/>
      But tonight,
      <br/>
      we are going up
      <br/>
      against Satan's Cavemen.
      <br/>
      And I just thought
      <br/>
      it would be a good idea if you...
      <br/>
      Praise the Lord!
      <br/>
      Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.
      <br/>
      Hey! Hey!
      <br/>
      Tag me!
      <br/>
      What? What are you doing?
      <br/>
      No, no, no, no! No, no!
      <br/>
      Ignacio.
      <br/>
      No! No, no, no! No, no, no!
      <br/>
      What the...
      <br/>
      Move!
      <br/>
      Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
      <br/>
      Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
      <br/>
      Chancho! Put him down!
      <br/>
      -Fight! Fight!
      <br/>
      -Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!
      <br/>
      -Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
      <br/>
      -Please, stop it!
      <br/>
      Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!
      <br/>
      What's wrong with you?
      <br/>
      But, Sister,
      <br/>
      they are just nios trying
      <br/>
      to release their wiggles.
      <br/>
      Ignacio, they are wrestling
      <br/>
      in a sacred place.
      <br/>
      Okay, orphans, listen to me.
      <br/>
      Listen to Ignacio.
      <br/>
      I know it is fun to wrestle.
      <br/>
      A nice pile-drive to the face,
      <br/>
      or a punch to the face,
      <br/>
      but you cannot do it.
      <br/>
      Because it is in the Bible
      <br/>
      not to wrestle your neighbor.
      <br/>
      So you've never wrestled?
      <br/>
      Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.
      <br/>
      Listen, I know the wrestlers
      <br/>
      get all the fancy ladies,
      <br/>
      and the clothes,
      <br/>
      and the free creams and lotions,
      <br/>
      but my life is good.
      <br/>
      Really good.
      <br/>
      I get to wake up every morning
      <br/>
      at 5:00 a.m. and make some soup.
      <br/>
      It's the best. I love it.
      <br/>
      I get to lay in a bed by myself
      <br/>
      all of my life.
      <br/>
      It's fantastic.
      <br/>
      Go.
      <br/>
      Go away!
      <br/>
      Read some books!
      <br/>
      Have you ever had feelings for a nun?
      <br/>
      No way.
      <br/>
      There is this nun.
      <br/>
      I just wish I could take off this robe
      <br/>
      so she could see how strong I am.
      <br/>
      Well, bring her
      <br/>
      to our next wrestling match.
      <br/>
      Yeah, right.
      <br/>
      Then I'll get kicked
      <br/>
      out of the monastery.
      <br/>
      I have an idea.
      <br/>
      Tell me.
      <br/>
      Take her on a date tonight
      <br/>
      and I will bring some of my friends
      <br/>
      to beat you up,
      <br/>
      but we will let you win.
      <br/>
      So where are you taking me?
      <br/>
      Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.
      <br/>
      There were two bums,
      <br/>
      and I said to myself,
      <br/>
      ''Let's talk to these guys
      <br/>
      about the Gospel.''
      <br/>
      Well, where are they?
      <br/>
      I don't see them.
      <br/>
      They should be coming by.
      <br/>
      Where is your robe, Ignacio?
      <br/>
      It was stinky.
      <br/>
      But these are my recreation clothes.
      <br/>
      -They look expensive.
      <br/>
      -Thank you.
      <br/>
      I mean, yes,
      <br/>
      they may have
      <br/>
      the appearance of riches,
      <br/>
      but beneath the clothes, we find a man.
      <br/>
      And beneath a man,
      <br/>
      we find his nucleus.
      <br/>
      -Nucleus?
      <br/>
      -Yes.
      <br/>
      Listen, I don't like the way
      <br/>
      those guys just looked at you.
      <br/>
      Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun?
      <br/>
      And if you guys
      <br/>
      have a problem with that,
      <br/>
      well, you can just fight me.
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      You ready?
      <br/>
      You messed with
      <br/>
      the wrong guy this time.
      <br/>
      You ever seen these moves? Huh?
      <br/>
      You see these moves? Huh?
      <br/>
      You think you gonna... Huh?
      <br/>
      -Come on!
      <br/>
      -This way. I think he's over here.
      <br/>
      Surprise.
      <br/>
      Get that corn out of my face!
      <br/>
      Release! Release!
      <br/>
      I looked like a fool last night!
      <br/>
      What took you so long?
      <br/>
      It's no use.
      <br/>
      I wanna be a great fighter,
      <br/>
      but I can't even beat
      <br/>
      a couple of guys in the street.
      <br/>
      Nacho.
      <br/>
      I think I know someone
      <br/>
      who can help you.
      <br/>
      -The Lord?
      <br/>
      -No.
      <br/>
      He's a water gypsy.
      <br/>
      He know wheres to find eagle eggs.
      <br/>
      Eagle eggs?
      <br/>
      I'm not listening to you. You're crazy.
      <br/>
      Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals.
      <br/>
      His eagle eggs possess
      <br/>
      magical powers.
      <br/>
      You could become the greatest fighter
      <br/>
      who ever lived.
      <br/>
      In order for you to become empowered
      <br/>
      by the eagle,
      <br/>
      you must climb that cliff,
      <br/>
      find the egg,
      <br/>
      crack open one of them,
      <br/>
      and then swallow the yolk.
      <br/>
      So, what you're saying to me
      <br/>
      is if I can eat this yolk,
      <br/>
      my moves will become
      <br/>
      the best in the whole world.
      <br/>
      Definitely.
      <br/>
      High five.
      <br/>
      -Summon your eagle powers.
      <br/>
      -What do you think I am doing?
      <br/>
      Eagle powers, come to me!
      <br/>
      Please!
      <br/>
      Tag. Tag! Tag!
      <br/>
      Those eggs were a lie, Steven.
      <br/>
      A lie!
      <br/>
      They gave me no eagle powers!
      <br/>
      They gave me no nutrients!
      <br/>
      Sorry.
      <br/>
      I don't want to get paid to lose.
      <br/>
      I want to win!
      <br/>
      I need professional help.
      <br/>
      I need Ramses.
      <br/>
      He's the best.
      <br/>
      We need to get in
      <br/>
      with him and his buddies.
      <br/>
      We must learn their ways.
      <br/>
      But they are pros.
      <br/>
      They only hang out with each other.
      <br/>
      Then we must go pro!
      <br/>
      But going pro is not that easy.
      <br/>
      It's political, obviously.
      <br/>
      My area, amigo.
      <br/>
      You see that guy over there?
      <br/>
      His name is Seor Ramon.
      <br/>
      He's Ramses' manager
      <br/>
      and he owns all of the big arenas.
      <br/>
      He's having a party tomorrow night.
      <br/>
      We need to go and show him
      <br/>
      we mean business,
      <br/>
      that we are ready for the big leagues.
      <br/>
      Over there in the tree
      <br/>
      is a chipmunk nest.
      <br/>
      Here we have the corn.
      <br/>
      The best in the city. It's delicious.
      <br/>
      That is where I get the day-old chips,
      <br/>
      over in a secret place.
      <br/>
      And that is a crazy lady.
      <br/>
      So now you got a little taste
      <br/>
      of what I do.
      <br/>
      It's pretty dang exciting, huh?
      <br/>
      Ramses!
      <br/>
      -How do you know him?
      <br/>
      -He's the best.
      <br/>
      No, he's not.
      <br/>
      May I have his autograph?
      <br/>
      Please?
      <br/>
      Okay. Let me see what I can do.
      <br/>
      Ramses.
      <br/>
      How are you?
      <br/>
      Hi.
      <br/>
      I was wondering
      <br/>
      if the children could get a
      <br/>
      signature from you and maybe a picture.
      <br/>
      Listen, the kids are orphans.
      <br/>
      They like you. You are the best.
      <br/>
      This party's gonna be crazy.
      <br/>
      I mean, we're gonna be pros.
      <br/>
      Feel it.
      <br/>
      Go on. I made them.
      <br/>
      Go lay down.
      <br/>
      Ignacio, I've been looking for you.
      <br/>
      -Where have you been?
      <br/>
      -I've been here.
      <br/>
      I've been sleeping.
      <br/>
      In a frilly shirt and slacks?
      <br/>
      They are my PJs.
      <br/>
      Can I come in?
      <br/>
      No, people might get
      <br/>
      the wrong idea about you.
      <br/>
      Like maybe you are a floozy.
      <br/>
      Ignacio, I was in the kitchen
      <br/>
      and there's no food
      <br/>
      for tomorrow's breakfast.
      <br/>
      Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
      <br/>
      -But when?
      <br/>
      -Good night.
      <br/>
      Hey, let go my blouse.
      <br/>
      We are wrestlers, too. We are invited.
      <br/>
      -Give me a boost.
      <br/>
      -Okay.
      <br/>
      Hey. What about me?
      <br/>
      I don't think I can lift you.
      <br/>
      You are too fat.
      <br/>
      Good luck.
      <br/>
      Seor Ramon.
      <br/>
      -Who are you?
      <br/>
      -I am Esqueleto, the luchador.
      <br/>
      Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo.
      <br/>
      I think that me and my friend
      <br/>
      are ready to go pro.
      <br/>
      Ramses, would you like to fight
      <br/>
      this man in the ring?
      <br/>
      So you want to make a name
      <br/>
      for yourself, horseface?
      <br/>
      Win the Battle Jam next week.
      <br/>
      The winner will fight Ramses
      <br/>
      in exhibition
      <br/>
      in front of 5,000 people.
      <br/>
      Then you will be a pro.
      <br/>
      I forgive you.
      <br/>
      Come here, soldier.
      <br/>
      How did you get up here so fast?
      <br/>
      Secret tunnels.
      <br/>
      Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.
      <br/>
      That they save themselves for the ring.
      <br/>
      Huh?
      <br/>
      I love you.
      <br/>
      Sing!
      <br/>
      Sing something for Ramses!
      <br/>
      Okay, my friend, this one's yours.
      <br/>
      What?
      <br/>
      This one yours.
      <br/>
      I am singing at the party
      <br/>
      I am singing
      <br/>
      It's my turn to sing at the party
      <br/>
      Everyone is dancing
      <br/>
      Happy party
      <br/>
      But Ramses is not dancing
      <br/>
      He does not dance at the parties
      <br/>
      Ramses is number one
      <br/>
      He knows the secrets of desire
      <br/>
      Ramses is the one
      <br/>
      He puts the people all on fire
      <br/>
      Ramses
      <br/>
      Steven!
      <br/>
      Come here.
      <br/>
      That party was lame.
      <br/>
      I hate that place.
      <br/>
      Hey!
      <br/>
      Take it easy.
      <br/>
      It sucks to be me right now!
      <br/>
      -How come?
      <br/>
      -How come you think?
      <br/>
      I used to really like Ramses.
      <br/>
      I wanted to become him.
      <br/>
      But it turns out he's a real douche.
      <br/>
      Well, win the Battle Jam this week
      <br/>
      and you can fight him yourself.
      <br/>
      Forget it.
      <br/>
      What?
      <br/>
      Because I can't go on living a lie.
      <br/>
      Earth to Steven.
      <br/>
      I'm a friar.
      <br/>
      I'm not for that world.
      <br/>
      The orphans, they need me,
      <br/>
      and I have forsaken them.
      <br/>
      I got no groceries for breakfast
      <br/>
      because of you!
      <br/>
      I'm sick of hearing
      <br/>
      about your stupid orphans.
      <br/>
      -What did you just say?
      <br/>
      -I hate orphans.
      <br/>
      -Say it again to my face.
      <br/>
      -I hate them!
      <br/>
      Come again?
      <br/>
      I hate all the orphans
      <br/>
      in the whole world.
      <br/>
      I'm not listening to you.
      <br/>
      You only believe in science.
      <br/>
      That's probably why we never win.
      <br/>
      We never win because you are fat.
      <br/>
      Buenos das, Sister.
      <br/>
      So, what you cooking?
      <br/>
      Breakfast.
      <br/>
      Ignacio, you have a responsibility
      <br/>
      to these children.
      <br/>
      I know.
      <br/>
      Well, where have you been?
      <br/>
      I've been gone because I had
      <br/>
      a lot of church-y opportunities lately,
      <br/>
      outside of the orphanage.
      <br/>
      Like what? Where were you last night?
      <br/>
      To tell you the truth,
      <br/>
      I went to a wrestling match.
      <br/>
      You went to watch a wrestling match?
      <br/>
      Kind of.
      <br/>
      You are a man of the cloth.
      <br/>
      Lucha libre, it's a sin.
      <br/>
      But why?
      <br/>
      Because those men fight for vanity,
      <br/>
      for money,
      <br/>
      for false pride.
      <br/>
      Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.
      <br/>
      But is it always a sin to fight?
      <br/>
      No.
      <br/>
      lf you fight for something noble,
      <br/>
      or for someone who needs your help,
      <br/>
      only then will God bless you in battle.
      <br/>
      You must pray for forgiveness.
      <br/>
      Excuse me, Ignacio.
      <br/>
      Precious Father,
      <br/>
      why have you given me
      <br/>
      this desire to wrestle
      <br/>
      and then made me
      <br/>
      such a stinky warrior?
      <br/>
      Have I focused too much on my boots
      <br/>
      and all my fame and my stretchy pants?
      <br/>
      Wait a second.
      <br/>
      Maybe you want me to fight
      <br/>
      and give everything I win
      <br/>
      to the little ones who have nothing
      <br/>
      so they can have better foods
      <br/>
      and a better life.
      <br/>
      Yeah, maybe that.
      <br/>
      Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam,
      <br/>
      I will know that you bless my mission
      <br/>
      and that you want me to be
      <br/>
      a wrestling servant of you.
      <br/>
      I smell cookies.
      <br/>
      Flame! Flame!
      <br/>
      No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!
      <br/>
      Roll, you fool!
      <br/>
      Flame, flame, flame!
      <br/>
      Yes, it's true!
      <br/>
      I am Nacho, the luchador.
      <br/>
      Who?
      <br/>
      Maybe you have seen me on TV.
      <br/>
      Nacho!
      <br/>
      No. This is forbidden.
      <br/>
      I knew it.
      <br/>
      He is not a man of God.
      <br/>
      Tonight,
      <br/>
      I will fight
      <br/>
      the seven strongest men in town,
      <br/>
      maybe the world,
      <br/>
      and I will win
      <br/>
      because our Heavenly Father
      <br/>
      will be in the ring with me.
      <br/>
      And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.
      <br/>
      And with it,
      <br/>
      I will buy the orphans a big bus
      <br/>
      to go on field trips to parks
      <br/>
      and places like that.
      <br/>
      I'm serious!
      <br/>
      Nipple twist!
      <br/>
      You can't win them all.
      <br/>
      Nacho!
      <br/>
      Where are you going?
      <br/>
      There is no place for me
      <br/>
      in this world, Chanchito.
      <br/>
      I don't belong out there
      <br/>
      and I don't belong in here,
      <br/>
      so I'm going into the wilderness,
      <br/>
      probably to die.
      <br/>
      Well, you might need this.
      <br/>
      My mother gave it to me
      <br/>
      before she died.
      <br/>
      It was her lucky machete.
      <br/>
      You can have it.
      <br/>
      I hope to see you again, little Chancho.
      <br/>
      Maybe in the next life.
      <br/>
      How did you find me here?
      <br/>
      I saw you from the village.
      <br/>
      I have some news.
      <br/>
      Silencio isn't going to be able
      <br/>
      to fight Ramses.
      <br/>
      He got injured.
      <br/>
      Silencio bruised his bunions.
      <br/>
      They are swollen really hard.
      <br/>
      He's not gonna be able to fight tonight.
      <br/>
      You were second place.
      <br/>
      You get to fight Ramses.
      <br/>
      But I have given up wrestling.
      <br/>
      Nacho, you are a great fighter.
      <br/>
      And you got something
      <br/>
      none of these guys have.
      <br/>
      The childrens need a real hero.
      <br/>
      But I thought you hated
      <br/>
      all the orphans in the whole world.
      <br/>
      Not anymore.
      <br/>
      I like them.
      <br/>
      And they need you, Nacho.
      <br/>
      Okay.
      <br/>
      Dear Sister, I know
      <br/>
      you probably hate my guts by now
      <br/>
      and already believe that I must have
      <br/>
      died long ago in the wilderness.
      <br/>
      But you are wrong, I'm still alive.
      <br/>
      Tonight I'll be fighting
      <br/>
      the greatest wrestler who ever lived,
      <br/>
      the great Ramses.
      <br/>
      I know you don't like wrestling,
      <br/>
      but know that I am leaving
      <br/>
      all my monies to the orphans.
      <br/>
      And if I die in the ring, know that
      <br/>
      I always loved you as a brother in God.
      <br/>
      Ignacio.
      <br/>
      P.S. lf we didn't end up taking
      <br/>
      our vows of celibacy,
      <br/>
      we could maybe get married
      <br/>
      and have a family with some nios.
      <br/>
      But, you know, whatever.
      <br/>
      Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,
      <br/>
      hug, hug, big kiss,
      <br/>
      little hug, kiss, kiss, little kiss.
      <br/>
      Ramses is the number one.
      <br/>
      His legs are number one.
      <br/>
      His eyes are number one.
      <br/>
      His muscles are number one.
      <br/>
      Ramses is the number one.
      <br/>
      While I was in the wilderness
      <br/>
      I wrote a song for Encarnacin
      <br/>
      in my mind.
      <br/>
      -Shall I sing it for you?
      <br/>
      -Sure.
      <br/>
      When the fantasy has ended
      <br/>
      And all the children are gone
      <br/>
      Something good inside me
      <br/>
      Helps me to carry on
      <br/>
      I ate some bugs
      <br/>
      I ate some grass
      <br/>
      I used my hand
      <br/>
      To wipe my tears
      <br/>
      To kiss your mouth
      <br/>
      I'd break my vow
      <br/>
      No, no, no
      <br/>
      No, no, no way, Jos
      <br/>
      Unless you want to
      <br/>
      Then we'd break our vows together
      <br/>
      Encarnacin
      <br/>
      Encarnacin
      <br/>
      Encarnacin
      <br/>
      Encarnacin
      <br/>
      They are ready for you now.
      <br/>
      Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!
      <br/>
      Maybe we should pray.
      <br/>
      Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
      <br/>
      with nutrients and strength.
